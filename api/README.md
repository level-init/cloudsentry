# CloudSentry API

## Run locally

From the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ./api
cloudsentry-api
```

Then, in a second terminal:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/health
```

Expected response: `{"status":"ok"}`.

Stop the server with Ctrl+C. `DATABASE_URL` is optional for this skeleton. The default in `app/config.py` is a placeholder and is not used by `/health`.
