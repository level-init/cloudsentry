# CloudSentry API

## Run locally

From the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ./api
cloudsentry-api
```

Then, in a second terminal:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/health
```

Expected response: `{"status":"ok"}`.

Stop the server with Ctrl+C. `DATABASE_URL` is optional for this skeleton. The default in `app/config.py` is a placeholder and is not used by `/health`.

## Core schemas

`app/schemas.py` defines the inventory records: `Resource`, `Metric`, `CostRecord`, `Dependency`, `Incident`, and `Policy`. A resource carries `owner`, `team`, `environment`, `business_criticality`, and `tags`. Invalid values are rejected by Pydantic.

`app/proposals.py` defines `Finding`, `RiskAssessment`, and `OptimizationProposal`. A proposal includes cost, savings, confidence, evidence, actions, a rollback plan, and approval, execution, and verification statuses. `model_dump_json()` produces an API response. Execution runs are not part of this module.
